# Refuses the tree if it carries the code that has been injected into this
# project three times: an obfuscated script hidden in a file nobody reads.
#
# Every one of those injections had the same shape. It appends itself to the
# end of a file that runs automatically - a Vite config, a VS Code task - after
# a long run of tab characters, so the line looks blank in a diff and the file
# looks untouched unless you check its size. It ships as `fa-solid-500.woff2`,
# a font name that does not exist in FontAwesome, which is really JavaScript.
# And it adds its own tooling to .gitignore so `git status` stays quiet.
#
# The checks are written against those habits rather than a hash, so a
# recompiled payload still trips them. Exit 1 means do not commit or push.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/scan-for-injected-code.sh            every tracked file on disk
#   scripts/scan-for-injected-code.sh --staged   what is about to be committed
#   scripts/scan-for-injected-code.sh <rev>      a commit, e.g. origin/main

REFUSED. The findings above match code that has been injected into this
project before. Do not commit, push, build, or open this folder in VS Code
until they are dealt with.

A false positive is possible - but every previous injection also looked like
a harmless file. Tell the team before overriding: git commit --no-verify
